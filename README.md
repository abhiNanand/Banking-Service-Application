# Banking-Service-Application
This Python project is a simple banking service application created using the tkinter library for the GUI. The application allows users to register with a PIN and name, which are stored in a dictionary. Once registered, users can deposit money, withdraw funds, and check their balance through separate interfaces. Deposits and withdrawals are managed by storing amounts in a dictionary linked to the user's name. The GUI includes buttons for each action, opening new windows where users enter their PIN and amount. The application provides basic feedback through message boxes, ensuring a smooth user experience.
